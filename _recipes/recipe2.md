## Ingredients

\-3 large Maris Piper potatoes, peeled and cut into large finger-sized pieces
-2l vegetable oil, for deep-frying
-50ml duck fat
-2 large duck eggs
-100g sliced jamón Ibérico or Bayonne ham

## Method

Step 1:
Put the potatoes in a pan of cold salted water. Bring to the boil, then simmer gently for about 5 mins or until they begin to crack but are still firm (like par-boiling roast potatoes). Drain and spread out on a baking tray. Put in the fridge and leave to cool for at least 1 hr.

Step 2:
Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan or deep-fat fryer to 130C or until a piece of bread browns in 1 min. Put the cooled potatoes in the hot oil and cook for 4-6 mins until they become soft and begin to brown slightly. You can cook all the chips together, but keep checking the temperature of the oil. Remove the chips with a slotted spoon. Drain on kitchen paper, then put back on the baking tray and chill in the fridge for 1 hr.

Step 3:
Reheat the oil to 190C or until a piece of bread browns in 15 secs. Lower the chips into the hot oil and deep-fry for 4 mins until they are browned and super-crisp. Lift the chips out of the oil with a slotted spoon onto a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain. Sprinkle with salt.

Step 4:
Meanwhile, get the duck fat nice and hot in a large frying pan before cracking in the eggs. Fry them gently at first, then turn up the heat if you like the whites crisp. Season generously.

Step 5:
Divide the ham between two plates with the fried eggs and a generous portion of the triple-cooked chips.
